1. For each of parts (a) through (d), indicate whether we would generally
expect the performance of a flexible statistical learning method to be
better or worse than an inflexible method. Justify your answer.

(a) The sample size n is extremely large, and the number of predictors
p is small.
Better - the model will take advantage of large number of observations

(b) The number of predictors p is extremely large, and the number
of observations n is small.
Worse - due to small sample size

(c) The relationship between the predictors and response is highly
non-linear.
Better - flexible is better than rigid to follow non linear relationships

(d) The variance of the error terms, i.e. σ^2 = Var(), is extremely
high.

To have high σ^2 means sample size is small and standard dev σ between yhat and Y is large
Hence, a flexible model would be worse

In other words, since the standard error (Var.u = SE.u^2 = σ^2/n) tells the 
average amount that the estimate of u (uhat) [the sample mean of the error]
differs from the true u (the mean of the error), the bias between yi and Y would be large i.e. a lot of the
values will be far from true Y so the noise woudl be prevalent.

Hence, a flexible model would cause to fit too much of the noise.
